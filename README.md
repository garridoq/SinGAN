# SinGAN for RecVis 2020

This is an adaptation of the original implementation of SinGAN :
[Project](https://tamarott.github.io/SinGAN.htm) | [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.01164.pdf) | [CVF](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Shaham_SinGAN_Learning_a_Generative_Model_From_a_Single_Natural_Image_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf) | [Supplementary materials](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/supplemental/Shaham_SinGAN_Learning_a_ICCV_2019_supplemental.pdf) | [Talk (ICCV`19)](https://youtu.be/mdAcPe74tZI?t=3191) 

Here we can train a SinGAN using n images, with the original behaviour being retrieved using n=1.


## Code

### Install dependencies

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This code was tested with python 3.6  

###  Train
To train SinGAN model on your own image, put the desired training image(s) under Input/Images/<input_folder>/ and run

```
python main_train.py --input_name <input_folder>
```

This will also use the resulting trained model to generate random samples starting from the coarsest scale (n=0).

To run this code on a cpu machine, specify `--not_cuda` when calling `main_train.py`

###  Random samples
To generate random samples from any starting generation scale, please first train SinGAN model on the desired image (as described above), then run 

```
python random_samples.py --input_name <training_image_folder_name> --mode random_samples --gen_start_scale <generation start scale number>
```

pay attention: for using the full model, specify the generation start scale to be 0, to start the generation from the second scale, specify it to be 1, and so on. 


###  Harmonization

To harmonize a pasted object into an image (See example in Fig. 13 in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.01164.pdf)), please first train SinGAN model on the desired background image (as described above), then save the naively pasted reference image and it's binary mask under "Input/Harmonization" (see saved images for an example). Run the command

```
python harmonization.py --input_name <training_image_folder> --ref_name <naively_pasted_reference_image_file_name> --harmonization_start_scale <scale to inject>

```

Please note that different injection scale will produce different harmonization effects. The coarsest injection scale equals 1.

###  Denoising

To denoise an image, run the command

```
python denoising.py --input_name <training_image_folder> --ref_name <image_to_denoise> --harmonization_start_scale <scale to inject>

```

Please note that different injection scale will produce different denoising effects. The coarsest injection scale equals 1.  

###  Paint to Image

For this task, we used the official implementation directly since we did not try this using multi-image training.
Please refer to the official implementation for more details.
